### Syndicate

AKA Investment club AKA Pooling funds to make an investment

Jason with his friends want to pool funds to purchase some real
estate.  They'd like it to be geographically diversified to minimize
country risks.

Each investment is proposed, discussed, and voted on with a stake.  An
investment manager is appointed, who will manage the legal/fiat
interface.  He has to put a collateral, that's larger than an amount
of the proposed investment.  He earns a management fee.

The decision to make an investment may be decided by vote.  Or each
invests just from his own stake.

### Credit union

Anita with coworkers wants to pool funds to provide collateral for
DeFi collateralized loans (like Dharma or Compound).  Only members
would be able to use this pool.  Members would vote on each case with
their stake.  Only those, who voted for will receive the additional
commission.  When borrower returns the loan in full and on time, she
earns a non-transferable reputation.

### Insurance fund

Drivers want to unite agains patrol police tyrany and decide to create
insurance fund.

There are two main roles: insured drivers and investors.

Drivers pay the cost of the insurance and may submit a claim.

Investors pool the money to achieve necessary reserve on the insurances
sold.  Investors also elect claim examiners, decide how to invest
the collected funds, and govern the fund in other ways.

Fund has an end of life moment, when it closes and distributes the
insurance premiums to its investors.  Investor's share in the fund is
a tradeable token.

Insurance payments and investments are collected and paid out in DAI.

Rational behaviour for investors would be to systematically reduce the
insured risks.

Parameters:

 - Reserve amount
 - Lifetime
 - Can the claim be submitted for more than once

Drivers can:

 - create insurance

 - pay insurance
 - submit claim

Investors can:

 - invest into the insurance pool
 - vote on claims
